# bonehead 0.1.1
An in-progress open-source 2D skeletal animation application done entirely in JS and HTML5 with Spine compatible output.

# Status
Currently a demo of the different mechanics necessary for image editing is present, with project file generation, editing, and importing soon to follow. 

# Goals
To create a high quality 2D skeletal animation app that functions in Google Chrome Canary and allows new comers to gaming to create animations easily from within their browser. Further, this software aims to be compatible with output from the professional 2D Skeletal animation software Spine, which can be purchased at http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-purchase. 

# Why?
During the last month my friends and I set out to make a game. We decided on using the Cocos2D-js engine. While this seemed to have plenty of support, it most visibily supported Spine for charater animations. Unfortunately, as Spine is paid software we were unable to make use of this built in skeletal support. Interested by the topics at hand, however, we set out to create our own open source software using web technologies to get he job done in a simple way. Now that school is back, we've put our game making dreams on hold, but I plan to continue messing around with things until I produce an animator that works, and hopefully eventually supports advanced actions. 

For me, this is more of a forray into animation. Although I'd like to claim to be both good at art and animating, I am not, but making an application that does animation is helping force me into researching principles and concepts I was previously unaware of, and if this can help someone out down the line I won't feel too bad about that either.

# Roadmap
<ol>
<li>Basic skeletal structure, JSON import/export for project files, ability to attach image files, positioning of selected item.</li>
<li>Bone visualiton using SVGs with web hooks for joint and endpoint positioning, grouped (bone) transformations.</li>
<li>Basic animation creation and visulation.</li>
<li>Dopesheet and event based animation.</li>
<li>Spritesheet/atlas generation support for output/import.</li>
<li>Spine compatible output.</li>
<li>The future (yet unknown, more goals will be added as UI and functionality needs become apparent).</li>
</ol>
